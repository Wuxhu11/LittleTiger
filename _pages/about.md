I am an Associate Professor at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/5161.htm), Beijing, China. I received a PhD degree from Telecom Paris, a school of [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en/about/facts-and-figures/rankings), France, under the supervision of Prof. Patrick Loiseau (Inria). During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting student at the [University of California at Berkeley](https://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/), United States, working with Prof. Jean Walrand. After completing my PhD, I was also a Research Fellow at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, supervised by Prof. Han Yu. 


My current research focuses on federated learning and its interplay with foundation models. I have published in leading venues spaning machine/federated learning, mathematical modeling and optimization, and computing systems, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICCV, AAAI, IJCAI, Artificial Intelligence, European Journal of Operational Research, IEEE Transactions/Journals (e.g., TBD, TPDS, TSC, JBHI), ACM Transactions (e.g., ToMPECS), and Performance Evaluation. In 2024, I received an outstanding student paper award at a workshop of NeurIPS 2024.
